# ‚ùå‚≠ï Tic Tac Toe Game in React

Hey! This is my take on the classic Tic Tac Toe game, built entirely with **React**. I focused on using functional components and hooks for clean, reliable state management, giving it a modern, dark-themed look.

## üîó Live Demo

You can try the live version of my game here:

## ‚ú® What's Inside

### Technology
* **React:** I built the entire UI and logic using React functional components.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** All the game logic (win checks, turns, etc.) is pure JavaScript.
* **CSS:** I used custom CSS for styling, focusing on a dark theme and a centered 3x3 board layout.
* **Create React App (CRA):** This project was set up using the standard CRA template.

### Key Features
* **State-Driven UI:** The board state, player turns, and game status are all managed using the `useState` hook. I avoided direct DOM manipulation (`innerHTML`) to keep the project clean and React-friendly.
* **Reliable Logic:** It includes accurate checking for all winning conditions (rows, columns, diagonals) and automatically detects a draw.
* **Clean Look:** It features a dark background, bright cyan accents, and clear X/O icons.

## üìÇ Project Structure Notes

The core game logic is contained in the `src/Component/TicTacToe` folder:

* `TicTacToe.jsx`: This is the main component. I put all the state, event handling (`toggle` function), and rendering logic here.
* `TicTacToe.css`: Contains all the visual styling for the game board, boxes, and buttons.
